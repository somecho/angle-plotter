## Rationale 

On the 7th of June I had a bike crash and broke my elbow. To help journal my recovery, I wanted something to measure the angle of my elbow flexion. A bit of a niche use case, but as you can see, it's nice for measuring bike frame geometry too, albeit roughly.

## Developing

Use `npx vite .` to start a dev server and `npx vite build .` to build for release.

# Todo 
- click and drag
- better interaction (accidentally closing loops)
- simplify render angle function
